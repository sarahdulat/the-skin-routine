            No reason to wash your face in the morning even if you use a retinol at night, UNLESS you get super greasy overnight or
            work out in the am. But if you want to start clean, any gentle non-stripping cleanser works.</p>
          <p>
            If you wear make up, sometimes a gentle exfoliant is good in the am to smooth your palette. I love this chemical exfoliant by Tatcha since it has a small amount of grit to make you feel clean.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fun fact: Many people use cleansers with chemical exfoliants wrong, work it in on a damp face and let it sit for a minute or two. Then gently start to massage in while rinsing. I used to think expensive cleansers were a scam until I realized this.

            Swipe your face with a cotton pad and toner if you wash your face in the am. I like micellar water or Thayer's
            non-alcoholic toner. No need to if you did not cleanse, skip to step 3.
