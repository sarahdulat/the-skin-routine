    <p>Hello, my name is Sarah and I am 35 years old. Most people have a few questions upon hearing this, the first one is usually, "What?!" followed by, "What is your skin routine?". This is when I have to admit that my daily skin routine is actually a bit involed, and has been since April 2018. Not that I didn't take care of my skin before, but April 2018 is when I introduced the routine that I still use (more or less).</p>
    <p>People asking these questions genuinely want to know my routine, but when I start to rattle off my 11-step routine they get a little glassy-eyed. "You're going to have to write this down for me." or "I'm going to watch you do your morning routine." <span class="glyph text-danger">ðŸ›‡</span></p>
    <p>After many of these conversations, I offered to put everything into a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PH3FHGTuFaOUuOaTCJxuLhv4Ril-zrSTL4Kd0aI74UA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Sheet</a> with the order, instructions, links and alternatives for other skin types/concerns. But I almost immediately got feedback on the sheet, "What if I'm not as dedicated as you?" or, "What if I have a smaller budget?". It was then that I decided to create a more interactive medium for not only my routine but also alternatives based on variables like budget and time. I hope you find the routine for you and explore new products that make your skin look it's best.</p>
    <p>I am aware that my perspective is very one-sided (as a cis white woman of 100% European descent) but I will do my best to do my research and add routines that work for all types of skin. <span class="glyph fs-5">ðŸ«‚</span> Keep coming back to see more routines being added!</p>
