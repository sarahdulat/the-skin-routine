If you have any redness/peeling/flaking, go every other night until your skin gets accustomed to it. Then work your way up to stronger concentrations.</p><p>Retinol encourages cell turnover so it helps with wrinkles and acne. I use a retinol cream from a derm, if you have a derm I recommend getting retinol Rx because it is cheaper and you know the dosage.
